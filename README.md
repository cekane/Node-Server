# Node-Server
## Test Server
After you have cloned the project and installed all the dependcies type 
```sh
  node .
```
Once the server is running it should tell you the ip and port that it is listening on. To make sure everything is working navigate to your browser and type
```sh
  http://localhost:4000/hello
```
Whatever message you type at the end should show up in your console.
